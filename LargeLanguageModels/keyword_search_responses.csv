When Julian asks what she would like to eat, Margot asks him for a cheeseburger and fries, having previously seen a photo of a young, happy Julian working at a fast-food restaurant. Moved by her simple request, Julian prepares the meal to her specifications. Margot takes a bite and praises his food, then asks if she can get it ""to go"". Julian packs the food for her and the staff allows her to leave, quietly encouraged by the other guests. Margot takes the Coast Guard boat docked nearby and escapes the island."
1,"Although their Mohe ancestors did not respect dogs, the Jurchens began to respect dogs around the time of the Ming dynasty, and passed this tradition on to the Manchus. It was prohibited in Jurchen culture to use dog skin, and forbidden for Jurchens to harm, kill, or eat dogs. For political reasons, the Jurchen leader Nurhaci chose variously to emphasize either differences or similarities in lifestyles with other peoples like the Mongols. Nurhaci said to the Mongols that ""the languages of the Chinese and Koreans are different, but their clothing and way of life is the same. It is the same with us Manchus (Jušen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same."" Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture. It was for pragmatic reasons of ""mutual opportunism,"" since Nurhaci said to the Mongols: ""You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat, and wear pelts. My people till the fields and live on grain. We two are not one country and we have different languages."""
2,"Other restaurants that occupy a place in French history and literature include Maxim's and Fouquet's. The restaurant of Hotel Ritz Paris, opened in 1898, was made famous by its chef, Auguste Escoffier. The 19th century also saw the appearance of new kinds of more modest restaurants, including the bistrot. The brasserie featured beer and was made popular during the 1867 Paris Exposition."
3,"In a letter of 1921 to Naimy, Gibran reported that doctors had told him to ""give up all kinds of work and exertion for six months, and do nothing but eat, drink and rest""; in 1922, Gibran was ordered to ""stay away from cities and city life"" and had rented a cottage near the sea, planning to move there with Marianna and to remain until ""this heart [regained] its orderly course""; this three-month summer in Scituate, he later told Haskell, was a refreshing time, during which he wrote some of ""the best Arabic poems"" he had ever written."
4,"Mites occupy a wide range of ecological niches. For example, Oribatida mites are important decomposers in many habitats. They eat a wide variety of material including living and dead plant and fungal material, lichens and carrion; some are predatory, though no oribatid mites are parasitic. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all invertebrate groups. They have exploited a wide array of habitats, and because of their small size go largely unnoticed. They are found in fresh and salt water, in the soil, in forests, pastures, agricultural crops, ornamental plants, thermal springs and caves. They inhabit organic debris of all kinds and are extremely numerous in leaf litter. They feed on animals, plants and fungi and some are parasites of plants and animals. Some 48,200 species of mites have been described, but there may be a million or more species as yet undescribed. The tropical species ""Archegozetes longisetosus"" is one of the strongest animals in the world, relative to its mass (100 μg): It lifts up to 1,182 times its own weight, over five times more than would be expected of such a minute animal. A mite also holds a speed record: for its length, ""Paratarsotomus macropalpis"" is the fastest animal on Earth."
